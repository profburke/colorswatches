## Changelog for Lua Colors library

### 2014-08-29 Version 0.9.1
	This is the first released version.

### 2014-08-29 Version 0.9.2
	Renamed to avoid class with existing module.
	I suppose technically I haven't renumbered this in proper accord
	with semantic versioning, but nobody but me is using thie library
	yet.
